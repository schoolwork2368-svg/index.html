we eat Rhys's broth from the communal trough. we think it is yummy, but we dont know what it is made of. we never see Rhys make his broth but it makes him very tired when he makes it. we think the rhys fluid is involved in the making of this broth. Ainsley is finna be the peh. when we eat the yummy rhys broth from the communal trough, we can feel quadballs floating inside the broth. he adds the quadballs to make the broth more quady and more bally. he gets the quadballs from a jar on the highest shelf. sometimes we see there is less flap juice in the flap juice bottle, so maybe he puts it in the broth. sometimes when we eat the yummy rhys broth from the communal trough, it makes us dizzy and we wake up in the Rhys Room. sometimes we wake up and his rare quadball collection is out, so we think he does something with his quadball collection while we are asleep. he told us to never put a quadball in his pit, under no circumstances. sometimes we dont want to eat the yummy rhys broth from the communal trough, but he makes us eat it anyway. he tells us that if we dont eat the yummy rhys broth, he will feed us his special quadball while we sleep. so we always eat the yummy rhys broth from the communal trough.
